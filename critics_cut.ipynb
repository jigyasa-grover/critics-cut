Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who developed the atomic bomb, and his later struggles with the consequences of his creation. Reviews highlight the film's mature storytelling, impressive visuals, and strong performances, particularly by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss.
